Fillet

This was my 4rd and first team based project.

It was really a fun project and i had a great teammate

The purpose was this project was to accept a file with tetromino's(tetris blocks) in it and place in the smalled grid possible.

The rule of it was the order was to be placed as much as possible in the left upper corner.

git clone the files and go inside the fillet directory. 

Type make to compile the executable.

Add a file with a max 26 tetrimino's as shown in the PDF to test the code
